README
======

This is done by [@sdoering](http://sdoering.github.com). Use it as you like, but delete the content from the index-page. As for now, my goal was to get a working version and to learn some stuff. 

There is a awfull lot wrong in there, a lot that could be much better. But it is working. So CSS, inline styles, et al. are OK for now. 

If you have ideas how to make it better, without adding to the web2.0-ish hype, contact me at [github](http://github.com/sdoering)

Have fun using it. Or send some hate-comments in my direction.
