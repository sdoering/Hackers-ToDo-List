Use it as you like, but **delete the content** from the index-page. As for now, my goal was to get a working version and to learn some (linux) stuff.\r\n\r\nThere is a awfull lot wrong in there, a lot that could be much better. But it is working. So CSS, inline styles, et al. are OK for now.\r\n\r\nIf you have ideas how to make it better, without adding to the web2.0-ish hype, contact me [@github.com](http://sdoering.github.com).\r\n\r\nAll \"code\" inside this repository is under the CreativeCommons Attribution Share Alike 3.0 License.\r\n\r\nHave fun using it.
